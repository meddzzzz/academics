Dataset Description:
Use any publicly available dataset (such as from FRED, RBI, MOSPI, World Bank, IMF, etc.). Provide full details of the dataset including source, time period, frequency, and a brief description of all the variables. Clearly indicate which variable(s) you are analysing.

Stationarity Check:
Examine whether the selected variable(s) are non-stationary.

Transformation (if required):
If non-stationary, transform the series into a stationary process using the appropriate techniques discussed in class/lab. Explain your method and its impact.

Trend and Seasonality Analysis:
Use regression techniques to detect and model trend and/or seasonality. Interpret the findings.

ACF and PACF Analysis:
Tabulate and plot the ACF and PACF for different lags (Use correlogram as well). Interpret the behavior of the series.

Model Identification:
Based on ACF and PACF, identify a suitable model for the series.

Unit Root Testing:
Conduct appropriate unit root tests and interpret the results.

ARIMA Modeling:
Fit an ARIMA model to the series. Explain model selection criteria, estimation results, and diagnostics.

Forecasting:
Generate forecasts using the estimated ARIMA model. Plot the forecasts with confidence intervals and interpret the results.
